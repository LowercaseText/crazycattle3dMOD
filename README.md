# CrazyCattle3D mod by LowercaseText
This is the source code to my fork of CrazyCattle3D. I will host the playable web game on github once some progress is done.
# How to compile
Use [Godot 4.4.1](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases/tag/4.4.1-stable) and package the game as any other Godot game.
# Legal
I own **NOTHING**, so if i will be asked to take down this repo, i will. All credit goes to [Anna](https://4nn4t4t.itch.io/).
partial credit to the original author of the repo I am forking for contributing in the blatant theft of the original source code.
